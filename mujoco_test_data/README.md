# MuJoCo Robot Test Case Database

This database contains comprehensive test cases for evaluating robot arm performance through MuJoCo simulation. The tests focus on assessing the robot's capabilities in various domains including kinematics, dynamics, control, planning, vision, and manipulation.

## Overview

The test cases are designed to evaluate robot performance rather than just testing the simulation itself. They assess how well the robot can perform specific tasks, how efficient its planning algorithms are, how accurate its control systems are, and how robust its perception and manipulation capabilities are.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- MuJoCo Python bindings
- NumPy
- pytest (for individual test execution)

### Running Tests

#### Option 1: Comprehensive Test Runner
```bash
python3 test_runner.py
```

This will run all test categories and generate a comprehensive report in JSON format.

#### Option 2: Individual Test Files
```bash
python3 -m pytest test_basic_setup.py -v
python3 -m pytest test_kinematics.py -v
python3 -m pytest test_dynamics.py -v
# ... etc
```

#### Option 3: Specific Test Functions
```bash
python3 -c "
from test_kinematics import test_forward_kinematics_single_joint
test_forward_kinematics_single_joint()
"
```

## Test Results

The test runner generates a comprehensive report (`mujoco_test_report.json`) containing:

- **Summary Statistics**: Total tests, passed/failed counts, success rate
- **Detailed Results**: Results for each test category and individual test
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution time for each test category
- **Timestamp**: When the tests were executed

## Customization

### Robot Model
Update the `model_path` parameter in the test runner or modify the XML path in individual test files to use your specific robot model.

### Test Parameters
Adjust thresholds, tolerances, and test scenarios in individual test files to match your robot's specifications and requirements.

### Adding New Tests
Create new test files following the existing pattern:
1. Import required modules
2. Define test functions with descriptive names
3. Use appropriate assertions to validate robot performance
4. Include error handling for robustness

## Test Design Philosophy

These tests are designed to:

1. **Evaluate Robot Capabilities**: Focus on what the robot can do, not just simulation accuracy
2. **Assess Real-World Performance**: Test scenarios that reflect actual robotic tasks
3. **Measure Efficiency**: Evaluate planning, control, and execution efficiency
4. **Validate Robustness**: Test performance under various conditions and constraints
5. **Provide Quantitative Metrics**: Generate measurable performance indicators

## Performance Benchmarks

The tests include various performance thresholds:

- **Accuracy**: Position errors < 0.01-0.02 meters
- **Precision**: Fine manipulation errors < 0.005 meters
- **Efficiency**: Planning steps < 100-200 for typical tasks
- **Robustness**: Success rates > 70-80% for complex tasks
- **Energy**: Control effort within reasonable bounds

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Model Loading Errors**: Ensure the robot XML file path is correct
2. **Body Name Errors**: Update body names in tests to match your model
3. **Joint Configuration**: Adjust joint configurations for your robot's DOF
4. **Performance Thresholds**: Modify thresholds based on your robot's capabilities

### Debug Mode
Add debug prints or modify test parameters to isolate specific issues:
```python
print(f"Current position: {current_pos}")
print(f"Target position: {target_pos}")
print(f"Error magnitude: {np.linalg.norm(error)}")
```

## Contributing

To add new test cases:
1. Follow the existing naming convention
2. Include comprehensive error handling
3. Add appropriate assertions and performance metrics
4. Update this README with new test descriptions
5. Ensure tests are robust and repeatable
